bigMobAttack:

bigMobAttack comes only in account, if BehaviorControl is set to true.
It determines, if a creature is a "big" one. If you set bigMobAttack to 3 (default value) all creatures >=3 are big creatures. This value is needed for some "value"-calculations

aggroboarder:

aggroboarder comes only in account, if BehaviorControl is set to true.
When EnemyHeroHP + EnemyHeroArmor <= aggroboarder, the bot is more likely to go face.
